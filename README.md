# js-testing-introduction-wn21

This repo was imported from 
https://github.com/academind/js-testing-introduction

It's the core code of the following tutorial:
https://academind.com/tutorials/javascript-testing-introduction/

We're using it in JavaScript classes so we can edit the code

We've chosen not to fork the code as the changes we make are not intended to 
update the tutorial, therefore so we don't clutter the tutorial with hundreds of 
unnecessary forks, we've used the import feature which disassociates our repo from 
the original, hence this notice of the origin of the code found here.
